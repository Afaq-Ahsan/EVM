after that other 2 owners approve that id of candidates
for voting one of owners start voting by entering seconds as parameters let suppose if you want voting start for 1 hour then write 3600 seconds
for 1 hour write 86400 as seconds
voters can vote between the start and end time of voting time
after time has ended 
owner click on endvoting and then click on fetch result 
and after that you can yeild result who is the winner by clicking on winners_idit will give you winners id 
this is how it works
